                      there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be rich). That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle.

                      historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features. All this to make architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983
                      that the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York in some years". At the same time
                      I also started a repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed the work in three months for $1.95 million, which
                      was $775,000 less than the initial budget!
